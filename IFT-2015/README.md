# TP 2 - Flappy Ghost

This project was conducted as part of the Computer programming 2 class. The goal was to program a game inspired by the well-know Flappy Bird, with a GUI made using the *JavaFX* library. The final game is compiled in the `TP2.jar` file. The source code can be found in the `src` directory.

## Usage

In order to work, the [*JavaFX* library](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) must be installed prior to running the program. After downloading the file `TP2.jar`, the program can be executed by calling the following command and by specifying the installation directory of the *JavaFX* library.
```
java --module-path <install directory>/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base,javafx.graphics -jar TP2.jar
```
